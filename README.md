    We built Tyrion to create better Graphical User Interface for the available
tools in Kali Linux. Kali Linux has many of their tools stored away in folders inside
their app drawer. It is cluttered not very efficient nor accessible. Their website provides some decent information about each tool but this requires that the user access the web and then dig through the webpage to find the selected tool they want to learn about. This isn't very accessible either. This is where Tyrion comes in, and hopefully where the name reference makes sense. Tyrion is the know-it-all-go-to reference for Kali Linux Tools. All the tools are presented for the user within the app. Easy to access, just click, and itâ€™s there, no need for an internet connection. Tyrion also provides a quick link to the command line to run the tool from. Straight from the app, no need to fidget finding that terminal. Hopefully the result is faster access to tools with more efficiency in finding information or to get to hacking without delay.

### GETTING STARTED

##### Requirements
In order to use this tool effectively please install on a Kali Linux OS

We ran and built this on: 4.9.0-kali3-amd64

Any other version we can not guarantee the operation of the app
*use command* `uname -r` *to check version*

#### Installing/Running

`Download zip file`

`Extract file in desired location`

`Open Tyrion directory`

`Open dist directory`

`Inside the Tyrion directory`

`Open Tyrion executable, located at very bottom`

`Done!`

#### HOW-TO
Tyrion is really simple to use -
You are presented with a welcome page and on the side are expandable Tool types.

*As of version 1.0 only the information gathering tool types have been added
More will be added in the future as well as interface updates.*

When you click the arrow to the left of Information Gathering, a list
will appear below from which you can scroll to see the many tools that are selectable.

When selecting a tool a tab will open, showing description of the tool, some usage tools
and some examples if available.

At the very bottom you can click on the button to run that very command on a command line
This will minimize Tyrion and show you a terminal, the command will have already been Entered
for you.

To return to Tyrion merely find the app on the app tray and click to maximize.

And thats it. Explore as much as desired. 

##### Built Using
