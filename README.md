# CYBER SECURITY FINAL PROJECT
## CSCI 4800/5800

## CURRENT TO DO LIST
- All Tools added to side bar,
- Used tools listed from Kali web page
- It seems each tool will need a tab and then we can
  hide the tabs later when implementing functions
- Currently 3 options when it comes to filling each tool Documentation
      1. Web parsing
            -requires internet
            -how can we add it to the design?
      2. Man pages
            - doesn't require internet
            - needs to be done in Kali Linux?
            - How to parse a man page?
      3. Manually copying information
            - doesn't require internet
            - Everything would be done Manually
            - lots of physical work
            - easiest option mentally
- I'm thinking due to simplicity, option 3 should be the way to go
- Then finish up GUI, and all the button functionality
- Once all that is done we can just focus and being able to call commands
  from the program to the command line
- And finish up with debugging, final touches


## UPDATES:
- Using a Mac
- Currently using Python 3.6.0
- Installed PyQt5 and using that for GUI

- UI needs to be finished
- Current Application name is Tyrion (Game of Thrones reference)

- Finishing up building GUI through designer and can
  add implementation last

## ISSUES:
- When using PyQt it requires the PyQt modules to be
  installed onto the system the applictaion will be run on
- This means we need to change the application so it
  can run without the modules needing to be installed
- Python offers a way to deploy the application to the desired
  operating system, so all should be good
- We are still able to code using PyQt5 because everything remains the same
- Need to figure out how we are adding data to each tool?

### DESCRIPTION:

- Create better Graphical User Interface for the available tools
   in Kali Linux
- Reduce the clutter that Kali Linux presents in its folder system
- Starting specifically with the Information Gathering tools
- Present an all in one "app" for the user
- Making available the list of information gathering tools
  with available descriptions, how-to, commands, in addition
  to allowing the user run the tools from the GUI itself,
  which may open the command line

#### TOOLS:

PyQt
Text Editor/Pycharm/IDE of choice
Command line
Kali Linux OS

### TO DO:
1. Build GUI
2. List information tools
3. Gather Information on each tool
4. How to get information from Kali site
5. Place onto GUI
6. Implementation
7. Debugging
8. Presentation
